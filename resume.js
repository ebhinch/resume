The 2018 election cycle was the first time CNN Digital has covered midterm elections and the first time CNN Digital has had a dedicated Politics team. Working on a collaborative, cross-functional, Agile team, allowed me to hone a very granular analysis technique, often anticipating issues before they arose - something that only furthered my development approach. I contributed to the production code base, building out dynamic new features that enhance user experience on the 2018 CNN Election Center. Working directly as part of the dev team, and putting my coding skills to work in a professional setting solidified that development is where my passion lies.",
